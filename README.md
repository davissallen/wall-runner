## game concept
Placed between two buildings of gargantuan proportion, run up while jumping from wall to wall to avoid obstacles.

## why?
I want to learn flutter, and I am fascinated by game design! I can't wait to get a glimpse of how games work!

## todo
- ~~complete udacity flutter course~~
- complete [this tutorial](https://jap.alekhin.io/create-mobile-game-flutter-flame-beginner-tutorial) on flame
- design the backend structure of my game
- acquire **_placeholder_** image assets for my game
- test and play game with minimal art to evaluate gameplay
- cycles of re-design and refactor
- add art (8-bit?)
